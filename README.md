About the project
------------------------------
An native HTML5/CSS3 & Javascript media player for video and audio.
Due to usage of very specialized CSS selectors like "input[type:range]::-webkit-slider-thumb{}", the players UI is accessible through webkit. Further Fallback (such as Flash for older browsers) will be included from version 0.2 on.
